A closure is a combination of functions bundled together with the reference to it's surrounding state.

In other words, a closure gives you an access to an outers function scope from an inner functions scope.

Closures are created everytime when the functions are created during run time.


=========LEXICAL SCOPING=================
Here all the functions enclosed inside the parent function have an access to all the properties of parent.
But doesn't have the access among themselves (child / enclosed functions)
And parent doesn't have access to the variables declared inside the child function.

==========CLOSURES===========
In lexical scoping we have seen the outside of the parent funtion we doesn't have access to 
the variables of the function ie. it returns all its lexical scope
